# British-Airways-Customer-Satisfaction-Dashboard

This repository contains the code and resources used to create an interactive dashboard analyzing British Airways customer satisfaction.

Project Goal:

Develop a comprehensive dashboard using Tableau to understand customer sentiment towards British Airways, identify areas for improvement, and enhance the overall passenger experience.

Data Sources:

Mo Chen's Youtube Channel

The data contains two .csv files, one with reviews of all categories and the other one containing the list of countries around the world. Both of the datasets are cleaned so you don't need to work upon them. You could however tinker around with the dataset and see how the dashboard varies.


Analysis Techniques:

1. Sentiment Analysis: Classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral to gauge overall sentiment towards different aspects of the flying experience (entertainment, service, comfort, food & beverage).
2. Text Analysis: Identify keywords and themes frequently mentioned in reviews to understand specific areas of praise or concern.
3. Geographical Analysis: (Optional, if applicable) Analyze sentiment trends across different routes or regions.


Dashboard Features:

- Interactive visualizations (charts, graphs, heatmaps) showcasing customer sentiment distribution by category (entertainment, service, etc.).
- Filters to explore data by specific routes, cabin classes, or timeframes.
- Ability to compare sentiment trends across different periods.


Technical Stack:

- Python (for data cleaning and manipulation, data was already cleaned when worked upon)
- Tableau (for creating the interactive dashboard)
